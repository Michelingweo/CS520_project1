It is another day on the deep space vessel Archaeopteryx, and you are a tiny bot. You're responsible for the safety
and security of the ship and crew. Unfortunately, the ship has been invaded by hostile aliens intent on kidnapping
you and your crew. Your crew have taken refuge beneath the floorpanels in the ship - your job is to find them and
teleport them away to safety, before you are grabbed by the aliens.
